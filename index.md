### My DECA Story

My DECA Story
From the moment I walked into my first DECA conference, I started a journey full of fun, passion, and friends. DECA wasn't like my other clubs, but it was a community of driven, passionate students who pushed each other to be better. That experience 

As a sophomore student , I've competed in ENT, ETDM, and BTDM. Each conference experience taught me valuable lessons about leadership, allowed me to meet so many cool people, and given me skills to bring home to better my community around me. Now, I'm ready to take those lessons and serve California DECA at the state level.

The VP of Leadership role resonates with me because it embodies the "Emerging Leaders" element of DECA's mission. This position isn't just about managing programs: it's about inspiring people, creating opportunities, and ensuring every member realizes their true leader. And it would be my honor to be your wingman on that journey.
