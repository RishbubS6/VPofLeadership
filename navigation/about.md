**Leadership In DECA: Beyond the Title**
Oftentimes, we see officer election results posted, and hear congratulations around the room for those selected. Suddenly, it feels like the leadership team for the next year, the ones who will have the biggest impact on a chapter, and help it go the extra, has been decided. 

But the fact is, the best leaders in DECA don’t need the “president” or “vice president” title attached to their names, and many don’t have those titles.

Real leaders are the sophomores who notice a new member sitting alone, and go to join them. Real leaders are the juniors who stay after every meeting to clean up, or see if there is any way they can help, without being asked. Real leaders are the seniors who share competition notes and tips with their underclassmen, despite technically being rivals competing in the same event.

If you walk into any chapter, you will find such leaders. The unofficial leaders who also help carry the chapter, in their own way. These members can be the member who is always ready with extra pens for everyone during a day everyone is practicing roleplays, or posts Instagram stories which highlight the successes of other chapter members, or the member who always texts another chapter member important dates, links, or information because that member had to miss a meeting. 

These actions all seem almost invisible. They don’t come with a title, or a position of importance. But they create the most important part of DECA: they create our culture.

When I think about those who have shaped my DECA experience, I think about more than the people at the front of the room during meetings. I also think of those who offered to be study buddies for the exam, or those who taught me the tricks of the VBC. I think of those who introduced me to other people at competitions, or those who helped me trade for pins at ICDC like a pro. Few of them are officers. All of them are leaders.

There is a key reason why chapters with members who are leaders who take initiative to lead change, however small, are so successful. Their leadership multiplies. When chapters have a team of five or six members trying to lead a group 50 strong, you make it so that one leadership member has to help train, encourage, and boost ten members. Anyone who has tried to lead can tell you that in itself is a challenge. But chapters where members help lead reduce the strain on their chosen officials. With such leaders, members learn from more, and the chapter is elevated to new heights.

The difference between traditional leadership and effective leadership is simple. One is something you are. The other is something you do. You don’t need permission to lead. You just need to see something you want to do or change, and do it. You can be the person who makes it happen. It's like a core tenet today's successful entrepreneurs follow: If you see a problem, or something that can be improved, you own the solution.
If you are reading this, and thinking, “But I’m just an ordinary DECA member”, take a moment and reflect. There are no “regular” members in DECA. We are all here because we bring something unique to the table. Maybe you're great at graphic design, and can help your chapter create promotional material. Maybe you're very organized, and can help create a chapter-wide calendar for key dates. Leadership isn’t something you are given. It's something you do.
So here's my challenge to you: stop waiting for permission. Stop thinking leadership is something you'll do "someday" when you have a title. Look around your chapter this week and identify one thing that you could make better. 
Then do it. Lead the change. At the end of the day, DECA doesn't need more people who want to be leaders. It needs more people who lead. That starts with you. With or without a title.
