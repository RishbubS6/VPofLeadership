#### Scouting America

My leadership journey didn't start with DECA—it started in Troop 685, which I've been a member of for over 5 years

As **Senior Patrol Leader (SPL)**, I was responsible for leading a troop of 90+ Scouts, planning meetings, coordinating activities, and ensuring every Scout — from the newest Scout to the most experienced Eagle Scout — felt supported and valued. This role taught me how to:

- **Delegate effectively** while still being accountable for outcomes
- **Lead by example** rather than by authority
- **Manage competing priorities** and keep projects on track
- **Mentor younger members** and help them discover their own leadership potential
- **Stay calm under pressure** when things don't go according to plan

Being **elected to the Order of the Arrow** by my peers was one of my proudest achievements — not because of the honor itself, but because it meant my fellow Scouts recognized me as someone who embodied the principles of service and leadership.

Attending **National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT)** was transformative. Over that week, I learned advanced leadership skills—**effective communication, team building, conflict resolution, and visioning**—that I've applied to every leadership role since. NYLT showed me that great leaders create environments where everyone can succeed, not just the most vocal or experienced members.

Now, as a **Junior Assistant Scoutmaster**, I guide planning and support our current leadership team with promotional initiatives, service, and coordination. I also directly mentor our Scouts as part of several programs I have helped develop for our troop since joining, including leading a comprehensive **Introductory Leadership Skills Training** session for our members.

**What does this mean for California DECA?**

The same skills that made me effective as SPL translate directly to VP of Leadership:

- **Servant leadership mindset** - I'm here to support chapters, not just manage programs
- **Experience with diverse groups** - Just like troops have Scouts of all ages and skill levels, DECA has chapters of all sizes and experience levels
- **Training in leadership development** - NYLT gave me frameworks for teaching leadership that I'm ready to share with DECA members
- **Commitment to service** - The Scout Oath and Law taught me to put service above self, and that's exactly how I'll approach this role

Scouting taught me that **leadership is earned through service, demonstrated through action, and measured by the success of those you lead**. That's the philosophy I'll bring to California DECA as your VP of Leadership.
