#### Scouting America

As an **Eagle Scout** and previous **Senior Patrol Leader (SPL)** of Troop 685, I was responsible for leading a troop of 90+ Scouts, planning meetings, coordinating activities, and ensuring every Scout — from the newest Scout to the most experienced Eagle Scout — felt supported and valued. This role taught me how to:

- **Delegate effectively** while still being accountable for outcomes
- **Lead by example** rather than by authority
- **Manage competing priorities** and keep projects on track
- **Mentor younger members** and help them discover their own leadership potential
- **Stay calm under pressure** when things don't go according to plan

Being **elected to the Order of the Arrow** by my peers was one of my proudest achievements — not because of the honor itself, but because it meant my fellow Scouts recognized me as someone who embodied the principles of service and leadership.

Attending **National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT)** was transformative. Over that week, I learned advanced leadership skills—**effective communication, team building, conflict resolution, and visioning**—that I've applied to every leadership role since. NYLT showed me that great leaders create environments where everyone can succeed, not just the most vocal or experienced members. This year, I'll be going back to the camp to help train the next year of great leaders in Scouting

Now, as a **Junior Assistant Scoutmaster**, I guide planning and support our current leadership team with promotional initiatives, service, and coordination. I also directly mentor our Scouts as part of several programs I have helped develop for our troop since joining, including leading a comprehensive **Introductory Leadership Skills Training** session for our members.

#### Public Forum Debate
As a member of Public Forum debate who cas **competed internationally**, I've practiced working with a team, preparing comprehensive arguments, and **adapting if something doesn't go as planned**. As part of this program, I've:

- **Thought on my feet** by responding to opponents arguments and questions in real time, off script
- **Worked with a team** to prepare group arguments and elevate our competitive performance
- **Speaking in front of crowds** to explain to the audience why what I say matters

#### Political Intern
I interned under California State Assemblymember Dr. Darshana Patel, helping her campaign and supporting efforts to reach and benefit the community, as well as managing a team of 50+ volunteers to coordinate door-to-door campaigning, phone banking, and outreach iniatives. In this role, I:

- **Kept up with a fast campaign** which made me think on the fly, adapt to situations in real time, and coordinate several aspects of a campaign together
- **Supported campaign advocacy** helping draft statements on a position, reaching out to voters to inform them about the election and the candidates, and setting up volunteer staffed events
- **Coordinate a team** of volunteers to ensure that the campaign ran smoothly, assigning districts to campaign in, events to set up, and phone line management

#### Community Volunteer
As an active member of my community, I help coordinate events with organizations, managing volunteers, ticketing, seating, catering services, and backstage work of all kinds. This role led me to:

- **Coordinate large events** with over 300 people in attendance, making sure that food was served, performers were ready and accomodated, and patrons were satisfied
- **Talk to patrons** to understand their needs, so that our organizations could serve them better
- **Led teams** to ensure that events ran smoothly and that everyone was on time, with people selling tickets, checking tickets, serving food, preparing performers, and everything in between

**What does this mean for California DECA?**

The same skills that made me effective as SPL, a debater, an intern, and a volunteer translate directly to VP of Leadership:

- **Servant leadership mindset** - I'm here to support chapters, not just manage programs. I want to serve YOU, because your success is my success
- **Experience with diverse groups** - Just like campaigns reaching out to individuals of all backgrounds, DECA has chapters of all sizes and experience levels, each of which I'm prepared to help Go The Extra
- **Training in leadership development** - attending NYLT and leading training courses has given me experience in leading and teaching leadership that I'm ready to share with DECA members
- **Commitment to service** - The Scout Oath and Law taught me to put service above self, and that's exactly how I'll approach this role

My experiences hae taught me that **leadership is earned through service, demonstrated through action, and measured by the success of those you lead**. Those are the ideals I'll bring to California DECA as your VP of Leadership.
