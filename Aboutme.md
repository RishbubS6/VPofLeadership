#### General

My name is Rishab Shyamal, and I am a sophomore at Del Norte High School. I prefer to approach challenges and opportunities systematically, preferring to fully understand a problem or goal before stepping up to solve or achieve it. I enjoy being **a leader in the activities I take part in**, from school clubs, to outside organizations. I pride myself most on my **dependability and consistency** in my work, helping me ensure that I leave everything I work on the best it can be.

#### Fun Facts About Me:

- I've backpacked through the Sierra Nevadas several times
- I speak three languages
- I have visited each continent at least once

A significant part of who I am has been shaped by my experiences in Scouting America. A Scouter since middle school, I greatly enjoy experiencing the great outdoors, and go camping and backpacking frequently. For my troop, Troop 685,  I have served as Navigation Instructor, Outdoor Ethics Guide, Order of the Arrow Representative, and Senior Patrol Leader. I was elected by my fellow scouts to the **Order of the Arrow**, the national honor society within scouting, and also attended the ***National Youth Leadership Training** as a representative of my troop. Scouting has taught me about leadership and being part of a team, developing my skills of communication, planning, and accountability. Scouting has also taught me early on that leadership isn't about visibility or bossing others around, but rather listening, being a servant leader, and following through to help others. I’ve extended these skills in the roles I have served within our troop, as well as to help pass on these skills to other scouts, having helped develop a leadership skills training program and course and teaching it within my troop to help prepare our next groups of leaders. 

I also enjoy participating in various events that require **communication and critical thinking** on the spot. Through activities such as Public Forum Debate and Mock Trial, I’ve worked on projects and presentations that require long term preparation, as well as **on the spot analysis and adaptation**. Preparing topic presentations months in advance, and working to present and argue them on the spot has taught me how to be precise, a critical thinker, and confident in my ideas, even if I may not agree with them. These experiences have strengthened my ability of clear communication and improvisation.

Other than that, I actively enjoy competing in various trivia competitions, having attended the National competition for Quizbowl as team captain to represent Del Norte. I enjoy Quizbowl because it challenges me to think quickly and allows me to work with a team, which makes it more fun. I also enjoy golfing, and it challenges me to practice patience, focus, and gradual improvement. Whenever I have a free weekend, I like to go hiking on a nearby trail, or to plan a camping/backpacking trip with my friends. Such activities in the outdoors often help me relax after a stressful week, or simply enjoy some time with friends. All of these hobbies are activities I’ve participated in for years and make up a distinct part of my identity.
